## 🧭 Overview

**AHE-Whisper** is an Apple-Silicon-optimized, end-to-end transcription and speaker-diarization engine.
It integrates multiple ASR, VAD, and embedding pipelines — each modular and swappable — to achieve **maximum speed, accuracy, and reproducibility** for TV production workflows such as *NHK World’s BIZ STREAM*.

## 🚀 Setup (Apple Silicon)

```bash
cd AHE-Whisper
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup_ahe_whisper.py --init
```

or (if using **uv**):

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run setup_ahe_whisper.py --init
```

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔹 MLX-accelerated Whisper inference (M-series optimized)
* 🔹 Adaptive Hybrid Engine: automatic VAD × ASR integration
* 🔹 OverlapDPAligner + Attractor clustering for overlapping speech
* 🔹 Speaker-aware transcription export (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.json`)
* 🔹 Deterministic reproducibility via `setup_ahe_whisper.py`
* 🔹 Offline execution (no external API dependency)

## 🧪 Typical Usage

```bash
python setup_ahe_whisper.py --transcribe input_audio.mp3
```

Outputs:

```
